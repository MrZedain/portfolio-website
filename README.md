# Pesonal Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio showcasing development projects, photography, videography, and creative hobbies.
Built with a strong emphasis on performance, design quality, and smooth user experience.

## Overview

This portfolio serves as both:

A technical showcase of frontend engineering practices

A creative canvas for visual work including photography, short films, and personal interests such as bouldering and horse riding

The site blends minimal UI design with motion-driven interactions and optimized media delivery.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router) – modern routing and layout composition

React – component-driven architecture

TypeScript – type safety and maintainability

Tailwind CSS – custom, utility-first design system

Framer Motion – smooth animations and scroll-based interactions

Cloudinary CDN – optimized image & video delivery

Lucide / React Icons – lightweight iconography

## 🎨 Design & UX Principles

Custom-built layout
No UI libraries for structure — all sections are designed and composed manually for full control.

Motion with purpose
Animations enhance hierarchy and storytelling:

Scroll-based hero transformations (scale, blur, opacity)

Seamless looping background media

Subtle hover and transition states

Visual-first presentation
Photography and videography are treated as first-class content, not decoration.

⚡ Performance & Media Optimization

A major focus of this project is efficient media handling:

CDN-based Media Delivery

All images and videos are served via Cloudinary

Assets are requested using public IDs, not bundled locally

Keeps the project lightweight and avoids bloated builds

Automatic Optimizations

f_auto – automatic format selection (WebP / AVIF where supported)

q_auto – smart compression without visible quality loss

Responsive resizing (e.g. w_1200) while preserving aspect ratio

Separate image & video pipelines for optimal delivery

Result

Faster initial page loads

Reduced bandwidth usage

Smooth playback even with media-heavy layouts

## 🖼 Creative Sections
